A lot easier than the Rock Paper Scissors UI. Maybe even easier than the basic console version of it. Maybe I was right when I wrote that my code for it may have had negative impact on the UI project.

Grid took a while. Half of it was Googling + trial and error, half was actually kinda having an idea what to do. Eventually it worked out.

Coloring tiles with mouse hover was easier than I thought it would be. It just clicked immediately.

Reset button on the other hand was harder than I would've guessed. Had to really think the logic behind my grid function and how to reset it.
Giving new size values for the grid itself wasn't hard.

This (too) is one of those projects I'll be definetly coming back to later, adding additional features.
There was few optional steps which I'm gonna skip for now.
